<!-- 
when sentencepiece was giving error while installation, realized:

sentencepiece does not support python 3.13 yet.

Its latest version was released on Feb 19, 2024.

You need to downgrade to python 3.12

Hence, did this:
conda create -n py312 python=3.12
conda activate py312 -------- this gave an error tho
pip install sentencepiece

for the issue with conda activate ran it on powershell, worked
git bash was giving error 
i tried this:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned on powershell admin
conda init bash

then simply just closed the terminal and started wiht powershell and it got activated.

need to look at the columns, data formats
